# EmployeeSummary

## Instructions

You will build a software engineering team generator command line application. The application will prompt the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. This assignment must also pass all unit tests. When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user.

## User Story
As a manager
I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles

## Description
This is an app that will run as a Node CLI that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. It will prompt for information like name, id number, email, github, and what school they attend. Once all prompts are answered for each employee it will take that and format it into nice clean employee cards that hold all of their information.
